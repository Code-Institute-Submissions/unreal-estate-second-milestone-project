## UX
### Project Goals
Unreal Estate is a maze game with four different levels. Your mission is to help the slug to find his way home, to his shell, and become a snail.
The name of the game is one kind of tribute to [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) and wordplay at the same time.
This game is my second milestone project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
My goal was to build a simple game that relies heavily on JavasScript, so as a beginner at Interactive Frontend, I can achieve and show my fluency in Javascript.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to play a maze game with trying, but feasible levels.
* As a user, I want to know how many steps I solved the maze.
* As a user, I want to easily access the navigation and the levels.
* As a user, I want to send feedback to the developer of the game.


### Developer Goals

My goal was to learn and practice JavasScript and Jquery, and at the same time build my portfolio, and create something I would use.

### Design

With my design choices I wanted to conjure the old school game's feeling.
Container boxes, buttons and modals have rounded corners to make the image more friendly.

#### Color Scheme
To find out, what colors would match with the game's cheery and facetious feeling, I used [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/).
I also used [Eye Dropper Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eye-dropper/hmdcmlfkchdmnmnmheododdhjedfccka) to make sure that colors on my page are consistent.
My choiches were a green and blue to the maze, rules, and dashboard; yellow for the slug, the logo, and the level buttons, light pink to the background, and black for the walls.
Hex values of the colors I used:
- ![##FFF3FA](https://placehold.it/150x40#FFF3FA/FFFFFF?text=#FFF3FA)
- `#649B92`
- #68A376
- #ffc107
- #f7c873
