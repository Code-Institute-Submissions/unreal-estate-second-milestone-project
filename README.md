### Project Goals
Unreal Estate is a maze game with four different levels. You mission is to help the slug to find his way home, to his shell, and become a snail.
The name of the game is one kind of tribute to [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) and a wordplay in the same time.
This game is my second milestone project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/).
My goal was to build a simple game which relies heavily on JavasScript, so as a beginner at interactive frontend, I can achieve and show my fluency in Javascript.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to play a maze game with trying, but feasible levels.
* As a user, I want to know how many steps I solved the maze.
* As a user, I want to easily access the navigation and the levels.
* As a user, I want to send feedback to the developer of the game.


### Developer Goals

My goal was to learn and practice JavasScript and Jquery, and in the same time build my portfolio, and create something I would use.
